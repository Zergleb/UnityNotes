Relative force applies force to an object based on the facing of said object. Add Force applies force to an object without taking this into consideration so instead of a force pushing forward facing a force might always push north according to the scene.

Vector3.forward is a thing. it can be used to determine which way is forward to push an object.

Is turning using the transform better than using some type of force to turn???

Need to import using UnityStandardAssets.CrossPlatformInput; to use CrossPlatform input but sadly it doens't accept all inputs at once.

Turning off CrossPlatformInput but still using the class allows for desktop controls.

CrossPlatformInputManager.getAxis("Horizontal") is the same as Input.getAxis("Horizontal");

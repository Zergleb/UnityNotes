Enabling Physics is done by adding a Rigid Body component to the Game Object.

Capsule collider can be used for varying shapes of objects and is more efficient than mesh collider.

Can create simplified mesh colliders to be more performant when using mesh collider.

Camera can be perspective or orthographic. It says an upright arcade game uses orthographic but why? Probably check a dictionary. My guess is that perspective renders the edges like eyeballs while orthographic renders the edge scene the same as the middle scene.

Perspective cameras have a Field Of View setting. Making it so your distance doesn't change but you can fit a wider angle in.
